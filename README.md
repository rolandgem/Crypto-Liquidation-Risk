# Crypto-Liquidation-Risk

This analysis investigates liquidation risk in the crypto market.

I use the [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/register?ref=35587056) API and margin trading environment to show the relation between the degree of leverage used and the rate of liquidation.

Results and analysis can be found in **Crypto-Liquidation-Risk.ipynb**.
